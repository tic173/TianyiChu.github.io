              . Examples are given for co-rotating and co-propagating vortex pairs. The former show a correction to the rotation rate and, in general, to the centre and radius of rotation, while the latter recover the known result that the steady propagation velocity is unchanged. For unsteady configurations, the vortex solution matches to a far field in which acoustic waves are radiated.
