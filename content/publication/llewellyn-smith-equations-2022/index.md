abstract: Equations of motion for compressible point vortices in the plane are obtained
  in the limit of small Mach number, M , using a Rayleigh–Jansen expansion and the
  method of Matched Asymptotic Expansions. The solution in the region between vortices
  is matched to solutions around each vortex core. The motion of the vortices is modified
  over long time scales   O (  M 2  log ⁡  M  )   and   O (  M 2  )   . Examples are
  given for co-rotating and co-propagating vortex pairs. The former show a correction
  to the rotation rate and, in general, to the centre and radius of rotation, while
  the latter recover the known result that the steady propagation velocity is unchanged.
  For unsteady configurations, the vortex solution matches to a far field in which
  acoustic waves are radiated.  This article is part of the theme issue ‘Mathematical
  problems in physical fluid dynamics (part 2)’.
